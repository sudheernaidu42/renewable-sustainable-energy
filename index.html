<h1 style="text-align: center;">ELECTRICITY USAGE IN THE WORLD</h1>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px;">
    Electricity consumption is an essential component of modern life. It provides clean and safe light throughout the day, refreshes homes on hot summer days in many countries, and warms them in winter in others. In all countries, it allows the use of electrical and electronic equipment essential for their proper functioning.
    Electric energy consumption is energy consumption in the form of electrical energy. About a fifth of global energy is consumed as electricity for residential, industrial, commercial, transportation, and other purposes. Increasing this share by further electrification is crucial to limiting climate change, as most other energy is consumed by burning fossil fuels, emitting greenhouse gases that trap heat.
    The global electricity consumption in 2022 was 24,398 terawatt-hour (TWh), almost exactly three times the amount of consumption in 1981 (8,132 TWh). China, the United States, India, and Japan accounted for more than half of the global share of electricity consumption. Electricity is one of the most important sources in human life. Especially now that we have entered the 21st century, there is hardly anything that does not work on electricity. However, due to the huge demand for electricity worldwide, it has become hard to produce electricity and provide it to everyone. However, if proper steps and measures are taken to save electricity, it is possible that both future and current mankind can use them. Here is a guide on how you can write the Save Electricity Essay via Vedantu and express all your views on the same. This essay writing helps not only kids from high classes but also those students present in the lower grades.

<i>Electric energy is most often measured either in joules (J), or in watt hours (W·h).
1 W·s = 1 J
1 W·h = 3,600 W·s = 3,600 J
1 kWh = 3,600 kWs = 1,000 Wh = 3.6 million W·s = 3.6 million J</i>

<p style="font-size:20px;">
    Global energy consumption growth slowed down in 2022 (+2.1%) but remained higher than its average 2010-2019 growth rate (+1.4%/year).
    Following economic trends, the growth in global energy consumption halved in 2022 (from +4.9% in 2021 to 2.1% in 2022, which remains higher than the average 2010-2019 rate (+1.4%/year).
    In 2022, energy consumption growth slowed down in the two largest consuming countries: it increased by 3% (compared to +5.2% in 2021) in China, the world's largest energy consumer (25% in 2022), while it rose by 1.8% in the USA (+4.9% in 2021). Strong economic growth pulled energy consumption in India (+7.3%), Indonesia (+21%), and Saudi Arabia (+8.4%), and to a lesser extent in Canada (+3.8%) and in Latin America (+2.7%, including +2.4% in Brazil and Mexico and +4.5% in Argentina). It also increased by around 3% in the Middle East and Africa (despite a 4.5% consumption drop in South Africa due to coal supply tensions and forced loadshedding in the power sector).
    On the contrary, primary energy consumption declined in Europe (-4%, including -4.4% in the EU, and around -3% in the UK and Türkiye), as fears of recession after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, surging energy prices, and milder temperatures incited industrial and residential consumers to cut their energy demand. In the CIS, energy consumption dipped by 3.2%, due to the war in Ukraine (-29%) and Western sanctions against Russia (-0.4%). Energy consumption in OECD-Asia remained broadly stable (South Korea, Australia) or slightly dipped (-1.1% in Japan).

<h2>EU electricity demand set to drop to lowest level in 20 years, but with global consumption expected to increase strongly in 2024, growth of renewables is more important than ever</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px;">
    Overall growth in electricity demand worldwide is expected to ease in 2023 as advanced economies grapple with the ongoing effects of the global energy crisis and an economic slowdown, according to the IEA’s latest Electricity Market Report.
    The report’s July update, published today, finds that electricity demand in the United States is expected to decline by almost 2% this year while demand in Japan is forecast to fall by 3%. Electricity demand in the European Union is set to drop by 3%, similar to the decrease recorded in 2022. Following these two consecutive declines, which together amount to the EU’s largest slump in demand on record, EU electricity consumption is poised to drop to levels last seen in 2002.
    As a result, global electricity demand is set to increase by slightly less than 2% this year, down from a rate of 2.3% in 2022. But assuming an improving world economic outlook, demand growth is expected to pick up again in 2024, rebounding to 3.3%, according to the IEA’s latest projections.
    Rising global electricity demand is still broadly supported by the electrification of energy systems as efforts ramp up to reduce emissions, by the increasing use of indoor cooling as temperatures climb, and by robust demand growth in emerging and developing economies, according to the IEA report. China’s demand is forecast to increase at an average annual rate of 5.2% over the next

 two years, only slightly below its 2015-19 average. Average annual growth in demand from India through 2024 is estimated at 6.5%, well above its 2015-19 average.
</p>
<p style="font-size:20px;">
    Even as demand in many regions expands, the strong deployment of renewables worldwide means they are now on track to meet all the additional growth in global electricity demand over the next two years. By 2024, renewables’ share of global electricity generation will exceed one-third. And depending on weather conditions, 2024 could well become the first year in which more electricity is generated worldwide from renewables than from coal.
    At the same time, electricity generated from fossil fuels is expected to decline over the next two years. Electricity generated from oil is projected to fall significantly, while coal-fired generation will slightly decline in 2023 and 2024, after rising 1.7% in 2022.
    “The world’s need for electricity is set to grow strongly in the years to come. The global increase in demand through 2024 is expected to amount to about three times the current electricity consumption of Germany,” said Keisuke Sadamori, the IEA’s Director for Energy Markets and Security. “And we’re encouraged to see renewables accounting for a rising share of electricity generation, resulting in declines in the use of fossil fuels for power generation. Now is the time for policymakers and the private sector to build on this momentum to ensure emissions from the power sector go into sustained decline.”
    In another sign the energy transition is taking hold, the IEA now sees electricity generated from fossil fuels falling in four out of the six years between 2019 and 2024. In the past, annual declines in fossil-fired generation were rare and occurred primarily after global energy and financial shocks when global electricity demand was suppressed. But in recent years, electricity generated from fossil fuels has lagged or fallen even when electricity demand expanded.
    That indicates the world is rapidly moving towards a tipping point in which global electricity generation from fossil fuels will increasingly be replaced by electricity from clean energy sources, the report finds.
    In particular, the report examines in detail the forces driving the declines in electricity demand in the EU. The bloc’s energy-intensive industries have not yet recovered from last year’s production slump, it finds. Almost two-thirds of the net reduction in EU electricity demand in 2022 is estimated to have come from energy-intensive industries contending with elevated energy prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This trend has continued well into 2023, despite prices for energy commodities and electricity falling from previous highs.

<h2>WORLD ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px;">
    The table lists 45 electricity-consuming countries, which used about 22,000 TWh. These countries comprise about 90% of the final consumption of 190+ countries. The final consumption to generate this electricity is provided for every country. The data is from 2022.
    In 2022, OECD's final electricity consumption was over 10,000 TWh. In that year, the industrial sector consumed about 42.2% of the electricity, with the residential sector consuming nearly 26.8%, the commercial and public services sectors consuming about 21.1%, the transport sector consuming nearly 1.8%, and the other sectors (such as agriculture and fishing) consuming nearly 8.1%. In recent decades, the consumption in the residential and commercial and public services sectors has grown, while the industry consumption has declined. More recently, the transport sector has witnessed an increase in consumption with the growth in the electric vehicle market.

<h2>ELECTRIFICATION OF TRANSPORT AND HEATING</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px;">
    As transport and heating become more climate-friendly, the environmental effect of energy consumption will be more determined by electricity.
    The International Energy Agency expects revisions of subsidies for fossil fuels which amounted to $550 billion in 2013, more than four times renewable energy subsidies. In this scenario, almost half of the increase in 2040 of electricity consumption is covered by more than 80% growth of renewable energy. Many new nuclear plants will be constructed, mainly to replace old ones. The nuclear part of electricity generation will increase from 11 to 12%. The renewable part goes up much more, from 21 to 33%. The IEA warns that in order to restrict global warming to 2 °C, carbon dioxide emissions must not exceed 1000 gigaton (Gt) from 2014. This limit is reached in 2040 and emissions will not drop to zero ever.
    The World Energy Council sees world electricity consumption increasing to more than 40,000 TWh/a in 2040. The fossil part of generation depends on energy policy. It can stay around 70% in the so-called Jazz scenario where countries rather independently "improvise" but it can also decrease to around 40% in the Symphony scenario if countries work "orchestrated" for more climate-friendly policy. Carbon dioxide emissions, 32 Gt/a in 2012, will increase to 46 Gt/a in Jazz but decrease to 26 Gt/a in Symphony. Accordingly, until 2040 the renewable part of generation will stay at about 20% in Jazz but increase to about 45% in Symphony.
    An EU survey conducted on climate and energy consumption in 2022 found that 63% of people in the European Union want energy costs to be dependent on use, with the greatest consumers paying more. This is compared to 83% in China, 63% in the UK, and 57% in the US. 24% of Americans surveyed believing that people and businesses should do more to cut their own usage (compared to 20% in the UK, 19% in the EU, and 17% in China).
    Nearly half of those polled in the European Union (47%) and the United Kingdom (45%) want their government to focus on the development of renewable energies. This is compared to 37% in both the United States and China when asked to list their priorities on energy

<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px;">
    Energy efficiency is the wave of the future. The world is quickly moving towards energy sustainability. At the same time, mankind is trying to re-establish the connection it once had with nature. An energy-efficient home is a personal step toward renewable energy, environmental protection, and sustainable living. Having such a home helps homeowners reduce their bills and provides an excellent investment. Furthermore, energy efficiency means healthier and more comfortable living that is in line with nature.
    Building or upgrading to an energy-efficient home requires an initial investment that

 is higher than the cost of a traditionally constructed home. However, there are government grants and incentives that can help get you started and offset some of the costs. After you live in your energy-efficient house for a few years, your upfront investment will pay for itself.
</p>
<p style="font-size:20px;">
    To understand exactly what you need to do to improve your home's efficiency, have a professional perform a home energy audit. You may choose to conduct your audit, but it will not be as precise. A good first step toward energy sustainability is generating your energy. Solar panels are the most practical and cost-effective way of producing electricity and heat on your property. In addition, proper insulation and draught-proofing are essential to cutting the amount of wasted energy consumed by your household.
    Testing your house for air-tightness and sealing air cracks does not take long, but it can prevent a great deal of heat and energy loss. Heating and cooling cost more money than any other system in your household. Select energy-efficient cooling and heating equipment, seal the ducts, maintain the equipment, and use it properly. You can also stop unwanted heat transfer by choosing more efficient doors and windows.
</p>
<p style="font-size:20px;">
    Making your home energy efficient includes reducing electricity, water, and fuel usage. You can choose a more efficient water heater and install fixtures that conserve water. Changing your laundering and showering habits also help to conserve water. Although lighting might not seem expensive, it is certainly a factor that contributes to your energy loss. Upgrading to LEDs and CFLs reduces energy loss. In addition, you should make more use of sunlight and natural daylight to lower your utility bill.
    Today's homes are outfitted with many electronics and appliances that waste energy in standby mode and through unwanted heat generation. You can avoid standby mode and acquire new energy-saving habits regarding cleaning, cooking, and doing laundry. Small changes in your habits can lead to significant cost reductions.
</p>
<p style="font-size:20px;">
    Another aspect of living an environmentally-friendly life is learning how to drive in a smart way that conserves petrol. Avoid rapid acceleration, hard braking, and apply other petrol-saving techniques. You could also consider making your next car purchase a hybrid, electric, or fuel-efficient vehicle.
    If you want to build a new energy-efficient home, doing so might be easier than upgrading your existing house. Today's ultra-efficient houses are built from the ground up with materials specially designed to reduce energy usage. Passive solar homes, earth-sheltered structures, and straw bale homes are a few non-traditional architectural styles that just might work for you.
    Being energy efficient means taking action to help protect the environment, but you can also allow the environment to help you. Your landscaping can bring you peace and leisure time in addition to making your house more energy-efficient.
    If you want to start saving money now, protect your health and the environment, do not hesitate to apply what this guide has taught you. Create a comfortable energy-efficient home and join the quickly approaching future of energy sustainability.
